    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    weight: string, optional (default=None)

    Returns
    -------

    --------

    Notes
    -----
    The Girvanâ€“Newman algorithm detects communities by progressively removing
    edges from the original graph. Algorithm removes edge with the highest
    betweenness centrality at each step. As the graph breaks down into pieces,
    the tightly knit community structure is exposed and result can be depicted
    as a dendogram.
